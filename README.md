# UCSDUnfoldingMaps16
Project developed during the course of Object Oriented Programming with Java - by UCSD

The course covers subjects such as Memory Models, Creating GUIs, Inheritence and Polymorphism, 
Responding to User Events, Searching and Sorting Algorithms. 

Using the Processing library and the Unfolding Maps library, we were able to develop and interactive map of the world 
that represents the earthquakes and cities with markers of various types and colors. 

I added an extension to the code that performs the following operation:
When the mouse hovers over an earthquake marker, the rank of the earthquake is displayed as extra information. 
Further, the earthquake marker itself and the ones with smaller magnitudes are displayed with a light shade of purple, 
and the ones with higher magnitudes are displayed with a dark shade of purple. When the mouse moves out of the marker, 
all markers are displayed with their usual colors according to the legend.
